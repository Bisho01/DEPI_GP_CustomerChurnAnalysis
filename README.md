# 📊 Customer Churn Analysis

## 📝 Overview
This project focuses on analyzing **customer churn** to understand the factors influencing **customer retention** and **attrition**. By leveraging **data science** techniques, we aim to build **predictive models** and extract insights to help businesses **reduce churn** and improve customer satisfaction.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains customer-related information, including:

- **🧑‍💼 Customer demographics** (gender, senior citizen, etc.)
- **📜 Subscription details** (contract type, tenure, payment method, etc.)
- **📊 Service usage** (internet usage, support requests, etc.)
- **⚠️ Churn status** (indicating whether a customer has left the service)

## 🎯 Objective
The main goals of this analysis are:

✅ Identify key factors that contribute to **customer churn**.  
✅ Build **machine learning models** to predict **churn probability**.  
✅ Provide **actionable insights** to help businesses reduce churn.  

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **🐍 Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- **📓 Jupyter Notebook** for analysis and visualization
- **🤖 Machine Learning Models** (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The analysis includes:

- 🔍 **Data cleaning and preprocessing**
- 📈 **Statistical summaries**
- 📊 **Data visualization** (correlations, distributions, feature importance)
