**Customer Churn Analysis**

**Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing customer churn to understand the factors influencing customer retention and attrition. By leveraging data science techniques, we aim to build predictive models and extract insights to help businesses reduce churn and improve customer satisfaction.

**Dataset**

The dataset contains customer-related information, including:

Customer demographics ( gender, senior cetizen, etc.)

Subscription details (contract type, tenure, payment method, etc.)

Service usage (internet usage, support requests, etc.)

Churn status (indicating whether a customer has left the service)

**Objective**

The main goals of this analysis are:

Identify key factors that contribute to customer churn.

Build machine learning models to predict churn probability.

Provide actionable insights **to reduce churn**.

**Technologies Used**

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)

Jupyter Notebook for analysis and visualization

Machine Learning Models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

The analysis includes:

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Statistical summaries

Data visualization (correlations, distributions, feature importance)
